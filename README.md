\## Dataset and Comparison



This repository does \*\*not\*\* include the original dataset due to size and licensing constraints.



The original dataset can be downloaded separately and placed under:





For qualitative evaluation, trajectory results generated by this code are visually compared against:

\- the original dataset frames

\- my own recorded drone footage



This comparison is used to verify:

\- small-object detectability

\- trajectory continuity

\- robustness against short-term detection loss





Example comparison results can be found in the `outputs/` directory.





\## Running the Code



Basic usage example:



```python

from track\_drone import track\_drone



trajectory = track\_drone(

&nbsp;   video\_path="input.mp4",

&nbsp;   visualize=True

)
